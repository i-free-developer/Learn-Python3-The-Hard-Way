# Designing and debugging

##### Rules for If-Statements

1. Every if-statement must have an else.
2. If this else should never be run because it doesn’t make sense, then you must use a diefunction in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the lastexercise. This will find many errors.
3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.This means if you put an if in an if, then you should be looking to move that second ifinto another function.
4. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if, elif, else grouping is like aset of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
5. Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to vari-ables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.

##### Rules for Loops

1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This only appliesto Python; other languages are different.
2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limitednumber of things to loop over.

##### Tips for Debugging

1. Do not use a “debugger.” A debugger is like doing a full-body scan on a sick person. Youdo not get any specific useful information, and you find a whole lot of information thatdoesn’t help and is just confusing.
2. The best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the values of variables atpoints in the program to see where they go wrong.
3. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Do not write massive filesof code before you try to run them. Code a little, run a little, fix a little.
